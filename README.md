# co-author_link_prediction_V1
This is a python code for implementing link prediction in two public available cauthorship networks datasets:

1-ArnetMiner 

2-dblp

Each cauthorship network is presented as a graph. The graph is generated using the R code Run network_graph_similarity.R script that generate also some similarity features between each two verices/nodes in the network. Those features in addition to other features that is extracted from author network are used to train machine larning classifer that does link prediction.

For more detials about this approach for link prediction and for uisng this code, please cite the following paper:
