# co-author_link_prediction_V1
This is a python code for implementing link prediction in two public available cauthorship networks datasets:

1-ArnetMiner 

2-dblp

Each cauthorship network is presented as a graph. The graph is generated by running the R code in network_graph_similarity.R script that generate also some similarity features between each two verices/nodes in the network . Those features in addition to other features that is extracted from author network (AMiner_Author_50000) that are used to train machine larning classifers that predict links between co-authors in each cauthorship network.
